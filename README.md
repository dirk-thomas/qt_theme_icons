Qt Theme Icons
--------------

This simple Qt application displays all icons defined in the [Freedesktop Icon Naming Specification](http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html).
It shows all icons in various sizes which are available on the system and provides filtering based on the icon names.
